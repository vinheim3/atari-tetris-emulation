# The 6502

There are many great guides on how the 6502 CPU works, and how to emulate it. I'll give a conceptual overview of the system to get a better understanding of it, and provide some resources. As it's conceptual, it's mainly for complete beginners

### The basics

The 6502 has a Program Counter (`PC`) which hold an address for a byte to execute. As instructions execute, PC will increment to execute new instructions or retrieve data for the current instruction

PC will begin at the 16-bit small-endian address stored in 0xfffc/0xfffd

The instructions have various purposes that make it simple to write programs:

* Arithmetic
* Stack control
* Comparing numbers
* Conditional branching
* Calling subroutines
* Bitwise operations

### Data storage

There are 3 8-bit registers: `A, X, Y`

Most operations use A, while X and Y are called 'Index registers'. If you imagine an array in a high-level lang, an index register can be used similar to an index to that array:

In a loop, you can refer to `<some address + X>` and increase X each iteration to refer to a series of addresses, rather than have a 16-bit, or 2 8-bit registers hold that `some address`

### Stack

The 6502 has a register `SP`, an 8-bit register that points to memory at `0x1??`, ie `0x100-0x1ff`. Pushes will store a value and decrement SP, while pops will increment SP, and read a value

### Interrupts

Certain external events can interrupt the normal flow of the CPU by causing it to jump to some predefined location.

There is the NMI (Non-maskable interrupt), which means that if hardware requests the CPU to be interrupted by this, it must happen, the CPU will jump to the 16-bit small-endian NMI vector address stored in 0xfffa/0xfffb. The Atari Tetris does not have anything requesting NMI.

There is also the IRQ, which is maskable, which means that if the 6502 is setup to disable interrupts, it does not have to service the interrupt and jump straight away, only when interrupts are re-enabled. The IRQ vector address is in 0xfffe/0xffff

Both interrupts, after jumping, will have pushed the return address, then flags (mentioned below) onto the stack, and disable interrupts. Typically the interrupt routines will end in `rti`, which reverses all these operations. An IRQ must be acknowledged, so that it doesn't get re-run when the interrupts are re-enabled via `rti`

### Processor flags

There are 8 flags in each bit of a register, `SR`

Some of these flags require us to understand how signed numbers can be stored as an 8-bit number. By using the 7th bit as a sign flag (1 if negative), we can have a signed value from -128 to 127

`0b10000000` would represent -128, counting up until `0b11111111`, which is -1, counting up to roll around to `0b00000000` which is 0, then counting up to the max value of `0b01111111` which is 127

These are the flags. The descriptions are typically when they occur, but they don't all affect all instructions:

| Bit | Flag name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 7 | Negative | Set based on bit 7 of a processed value |
| 6 | oVerflow | Set when an arithmetic operation causes a signed overflow, flipping its sign, eg 127+1=-128 or -128-1=127 |
| 5 | reserved | ??? |
| 4 | Break | Set when an instruction causes processor flags to be pushed to the stack |
| 3 | Decimal | Set by the `SED` instruction. Cleared by `CLD`. Affects if arithmetic operations will treat the hexadecimal operands as their actual byte value (eg 0x69+0x13 being 124 or 0x7c), or as the decimal value they look like (eg 0x69+0x13 being 0x82) |
| 2 | Interrupt disable | Determines if the CPU calls the IRQ subroutine when requested |
| 1 | Zero | Set when a value being processed is equal to 0 |
| 0 | Carry | Similar to the overflow flag, this is set when the byte would roll around the entire byte value, eg 0xff+1 or 0x00-1 |

### Cycles

Instructions take some time. The number of cycles is typically fixed, but things like pulling 16-bit addresses, can incur an extra cycle if it happens to wrap around a 0x100-byte page

### Address modes

The operands of an operation can vary so that developers can conveniently operate on a variety of registers, or memory addresses

| Shorthand | Long form | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `A` | accumulator | Instructions with this addressing mode involve the A register, eg `LSR A` means perform a logical shift right on A |
| `abs` | absolute | The 2 bytes after the instruction are a 16-bit memory address to operate on, eg `STA abs` means store A in the following 16-bit address |
| `abs, X` | absolute, X-indexed | Similar to above, but the address has X added on to it |
| `abs, Y` | absolute, Y-indexed | Similar to `abs, X`, but Y is added onto the absolute address |
| `#` | immediate | Similar to `abs`, the following 2 bytes are used as a constant value, rather than a memory address to read from, or write to, eg `LDA #12` will store 12 in A, and `LDA $1234` will read from 0x1234, and store its value in A |
| `impl` | implied | The instruction does not take an operand, it has a very unique purpose, eg `SED` sets the decimal processor flag |
| `ind` | indirect | 1 level of indirection above `abs`, eg `JMP ($1234)` will get a 16-bit address at 0x1234/0x1235, and will be used as the jump address, whereas `JMP $1234` will jump to 0x1234 |
| `X, ind` | X-indexed, indirect | Similar to above, but X is added to the following 16-bit address first, eg `LDA ($1234, X)` will get a 16-bit address at 0x1234+X/0x1235+X, then store that address' value in A |
| `ind, Y` | indirect, Y-indexed | Similar to `X, ind`, except Y is added after resolving that 1st level of indirection, eg `LDA ($1234) Y` will get a 16-bit address at 0x1234/0x1235, add Y to that address, then store its value in A |
| `rel` | relative | The following 8-bit address is to be used as a signed 8-bit value, and added to PC if the instruction's condition yields true |
| `zpg` | zeropage | Similar to `abs`, except 1 byte is read instead of 2, as it will refer to an address at `0x00??`, eg `LDA $12` will read from 0x0012 |
| `zpg, X` | zeropage, X-indexed | Like `abs, X` for `zpg` |
| `zpg, Y` | zeropage, Y-indexed | Like `abs, Y` for `zpg` |

For nestest, setup your CPU so that
* reading from 0xc000-0xffff reads from `nestest.nes` at offsets 0x10-0x400f
* reading/writing from 0x000-0x7ff reads/writes using some generic ram
* PC starts at 0xc000
